TelePhoto Cloud is a smart app that turns your Telegram account into your own personal "Google Photos." It gives you a way to save all your memories forever without paying for expensive monthly plans.

## 🧸 How does it work? (The "Simple" Version)

Imagine you have a giant, magical backpack (that's **Telegram**). You can put almost anything inside it, and it never gets full! 

1. **The Snap**: You take a photo on your phone.
2. **The Helper**: Our app is like a friendly robot. It sees your new photo and says, *"Hey! I should save this safely in the magical backpack!"* 🤖
3. **The Trip**: The app sends the photo to a private corner of your Telegram where only you can see it.
4. **The Magic**: Even if you delete the photo from your phone to save space, it stays safe in your Telegram backpack! You can look at it, download it back, or share it anytime you want.
