TelePhoto Cloud is a smart app that turns your Telegram account into your own personal "Google Photos." It gives you a way to save all your memories forever without paying for expensive monthly plans.

## 🧸 How does it work? (The "Simple" Version)

Imagine you have a giant, magical backpack (that's **Telegram**). You can put almost anything inside it, and it never gets full! 

1. **The Snap**: You take a photo on your phone.
2. **The Helper**: Our app is like a friendly robot. It sees your new photo and says, *"Hey! I should save this safely in the magical backpack!"* 🤖
3. **The Trip**: The app sends the photo to a private corner of your Telegram where only you can see it.
4. **The Magic**: Even if you delete the photo from your phone to save space, it stays safe in your Telegram backpack! You can look at it, download it back, or share it anytime you want.

## �️ How to set it up? (Even a kid can do it!)

To make the magic work, you need to tell our app where your "Magical Backpack" is. Follow these simple steps:

### 🤖 Step 1: Create your Robot Helper (Bot Token)
Think of a Bot Token as a **"Secret Password"** for your robot.
1. Open Telegram and search for **@BotFather** (He is the king of all robots!).
2. Tap **Start** and type `/newbot`.
3. Give your robot a name (like "MyPhotoBot").
4. Give it a username that ends in "bot" (like `MagicBackpack_bot`).
5. **Success!** BotFather will give you a long string of letters and numbers. That's your **Bot Token**. Copy it!

### 🏰 Step 2: Create your Secret Vault (Chat ID)
The Chat ID is like the **"Address"** of your secret room.
1. Create a **New Channel** in Telegram. Make it **Private**.
2. Give it a cool name like "My Secret Vault."
3. Add the robot you just created (the one from Step 1) as an **Administrator** to this channel.
4. Now, we need the address. Send a quick message like "Hello" in that channel.
5. Forward that message to **@IDBot** or search for **@MissRose_bot** and type `/id` inside your channel.
6. It will give you a number (usually starting with a `-`). That is your **Chat ID**. Copy it!

### 🔑 Step 3: Start the Magic
1. Open the **TelePhoto Cloud** app on your phone.
2. Go to **Settings**.
3. Paste the **Bot Token** and the **Chat ID** into the boxes.
4. Tap **Save** and you're done! Your robot is now ready to start packing your bags! 🎒
